This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Mood Tracker

## Requirements

Your users should be able to:
- Log mood, feelings, reflections, and sleep each day
- See today's mood, feelings, reflection, and sleep, once logged
- See a relevant mood quote based on today's mood (found in the data.json file)
- See a graph showing the most recent eleven records to identify mood and sleep trends
- Interact with each bar on the mood and sleep trends chart to see all information about that day
- See their average mood and sleep from the past five check-ins and see how they compare with the previous five
- Update their name or avatar through settings
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
- Bonus: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)
- Bonus: Integrate with a third-party image-hosting service for the avatar upload

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
